Brown the meat rolls along with a small carrot and 1/2 onion. Cut into fourths. When good and brown, add warm water to pot and simmer 1 hour or until rouladen is soft. Remove meat, cool, take off string, and replace. Add a bit of pickle juice (my mom's secret ingredient) and let simmer until rouladen are hot again. Put sauce into blender and liquify.
